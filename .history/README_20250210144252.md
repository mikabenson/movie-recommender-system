## Introduction 🌟
Here is my Phase 4 project for creating a Recommender system. I'm creating a recommender system on an item based collaborative filtering which provides top 5 movie Recommendation to users based on their ratings

## About the Challenge 🌐



### Challenge Details 📝

- **Goal**: Classify passengers as transported or not transported to an alternate dimension.
- **Datasets**: The competition provides a training dataset with personal records and a test dataset for predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Submissions are evaluated based on classification accuracy.

## Project Files 📂

Key files related to this project:

- [**train.csv**](./data/train.csv) - Training dataset with personal records and ground truth labels.
- [**test.csv**](./data/test.csv) - Test dataset for predictions.
- [**sample_submission.csv**](./data/sample_submission.csv) - Sample submission file with the required format.
- [**My Notebook**](./spaceship-titanic-weighted-ensemble.ipynb) or [**My Kaggle Notebook**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amirfares/spaceship-titanic-weighted-ensemble) - My notebook with code and analysis.

## My Approach 🚀

1. **Reading Datasets**: I began by loading the provided datasets, both the training and test data.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: I addressed missing data in the dataset, ensuring that no valuable information was lost.

3. **Checking Class Distribution**: To understand the balance between transported and non-transported passengers, I examined the distribution of classes in the training dataset.

4. **Data Visuakization** : I perform some visualization on the train csv to check for the features that affected the rate of transportation on the passengers

5. **Feature Engineering**: To improve model performance, I engineered new features. For example, I extracted additional information from the "numeric" column that had expenditure, summing them to the spending cost 

6. **One-Hot Encoding**: I prepared the categorical data for modeling by performing one-hot encoding, a necessary step for many machine learning models.

7. **Scaling**: I prepared the numeric data for modeling by performing scaling which is a necessary step for data Normalization.

8. **Extracting (X, y)**: I separated the feature matrix (X) and the target variable (y) from the training dataset, ensuring that the data was ready for model training.

9. **Creating the Models**: I created my baseline logistic regression model which was my reference model, then evaluated the accuracy score, plotted the ROC curve. I also improved my baseline model by applying the following model:
     - DecisionTreeClassifier
     - RandomForestClassifier
     - I performed tuning on these models to optimize their performance, checked its accuracy score and finally created the ROC curve 

10. **Making Predictions**: I got the predictions from the three models.

11. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: I gave few conclusion and recommendations i derived from the data
