## Introduction üåü
Here is my Phase 4 project for creating a Recommender system. I'm creating a recommender system on an item based collaborative filtering which provides top 5 


Here is my Data Science and Machine Learning project. I created this repository which houses my project from the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition. I'm working on trying to understand the mystery behind the passengers who were transported to an dimension during the Spaceship Titanic collision with the anomaly

**Key Insights & Results**:

- One of the most critical factors in predicting passenger transportation was the "CryoSleep" feature, showing a strong correlation of over 0.4. Passengers who opted for cryosleep were more likely to be transported to an alternate dimension.

- Through rigorous analysis and modeling, I achieved a commendable score of 0.80, securing a top 28% ranking among 2062 teams. My model's predictions played a vital role in the rescue mission's success.

## About the Challenge üåê

The Spaceship Titanic competition tasks us with solving a cosmic mystery. By leveraging data science skills, we aim to predict the fate of passengers who encountered a spacetime anomaly during their voyage.

### Challenge Details üìù

- **Goal**: Classify passengers as transported or not transported to an alternate dimension.
- **Datasets**: The competition provides a training dataset with personal records and a test dataset for predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Submissions are evaluated based on classification accuracy.

## Project Files üìÇ

Key files related to this project:

- [**train.csv**](./data/train.csv) - Training dataset with personal records and ground truth labels.
- [**test.csv**](./data/test.csv) - Test dataset for predictions.
- [**sample_submission.csv**](./data/sample_submission.csv) - Sample submission file with the required format.
- [**My Notebook**](./spaceship-titanic-weighted-ensemble.ipynb) or [**My Kaggle Notebook**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amirfares/spaceship-titanic-weighted-ensemble) - My notebook with code and analysis.

## My Approach üöÄ

1. **Reading Datasets**: I began by loading the provided datasets, both the training and test data.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: I addressed missing data in the dataset, ensuring that no valuable information was lost.

3. **Checking Class Distribution**: To understand the balance between transported and non-transported passengers, I examined the distribution of classes in the training dataset.

4. **Data Visuakization** : I perform some visualization on the train csv to check for the features that affected the rate of transportation on the passengers

5. **Feature Engineering**: To improve model performance, I engineered new features. For example, I extracted additional information from the "numeric" column that had expenditure, summing them to the spending cost 

6. **One-Hot Encoding**: I prepared the categorical data for modeling by performing one-hot encoding, a necessary step for many machine learning models.

7. **Scaling**: I prepared the numeric data for modeling by performing scaling which is a necessary step for data Normalization.

8. **Extracting (X, y)**: I separated the feature matrix (X) and the target variable (y) from the training dataset, ensuring that the data was ready for model training.

9. **Creating the Models**: I created my baseline logistic regression model which was my reference model, then evaluated the accuracy score, plotted the ROC curve. I also improved my baseline model by applying the following model:
     - DecisionTreeClassifier
     - RandomForestClassifier
     - I performed tuning on these models to optimize their performance, checked its accuracy score and finally created the ROC curve 

10. **Making Predictions**: I got the predictions from the three models.

11. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: I gave few conclusion and recommendations i derived from the data
